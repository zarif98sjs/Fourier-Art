# Code
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)<br>
  * Download and install <br> 
  * Write ```node``` in cmd to initiazie and chek if you vae properly installed Node.js
* [p5 Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5-manager)<br>
  * Although this tool is not mandatory , it helps to create projects and libraries are included in the project when it is created<br>
  * After installing Node.js write ```npm install p5-manager -g``` in cmd to install p5 manager <br>
  * Go the desired directory using cd and write ```p5 generate -b Fourier_Art``` <br>
  * It will crate a p5 javascript project named "Fourier_Art" with all the necessary files
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Download and install
* [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  * Install this extension in VSCOde to create a server 
  
Note : You can use other editors like Atom or Sublime . VSCode is just my preffered choice <br>

# How to use 
* Draw your artwork in Illustrator and export as svg format . Here's what I drew on illustrator : <br>
(You can find the illustrator file in the Art Ultima folder named *Art Ultima.ai* )

* Now convert it to x,y co-ordinates using [Coordinator](https://spotify.github.io/coordinator/)
* Copy with proper format in the Art.js . And you are good to go . <br>

*Enjoy the Fourier Transform*
